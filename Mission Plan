How i think we should start building coing or conceptualizing our project.

1) build simple grid layout where we can interact with by placing lines that will represent the circut itself. 
2) construct poles (+,-) and pass user input values through ie. DC volatge/current. Simple test. 
3) Add variables (resistors etc.) and add the math to the circuit upon placed variables.
4) Clean up GUI
5) add more variables and math that goes with them.
